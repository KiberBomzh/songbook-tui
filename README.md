# Description
This is a programm for storing songs, songbook in short words.
It use its own system for storing chords, not a chordpro format
(yes, i love to reinvent the wheel),
and not only chords, also you can mark stressed syllables with some symbols
(as a dot or some numbers or whatever you want, only one symbol per mark).
Also there's some notes (and a little bit of other stuff)


Written in pure Rust.
